Pizza with lettuce side and Cheesecake 

## 30 Minutes Prep Time
- Preheat oven to 230Â°C.
- Prepare the pizza dressing ingredients:
  - 200g mascarpone
  - 40g pecorino romano, finely grated
  - 4 anchovy fillets, drained and finely chopped
  - 8 sage leaves, finely chopped
  - 1 small lemon: finely grate the zest to get 1 tsp
- Prepare the potato topping:
  - 180g new potatoes, finely sliced (unpeeled) on a mandoline
- Prepare the gem lettuce:
  - 12 gem lettuces, trimmed at the bottom and cut lengthways into eighths (400g)
- Make the fridge-raid dressing:
  - 1/2 very ripe avocado, flesh scooped out (90g)
  - 3cm piece of ginger, peeled and roughly chopped (20g)
  - 1 small garlic clove, crushed
  - Juice of 2 lemons to get 3 tbsp
  - 1 green chili (deseeded if you don't like heat), roughly chopped
  - 1 tbsp tahini
  - 85ml olive oil
  - 1/4 tsp salt

## 30 Minutes Active Cooking Time
### Make the pizza dough:
- 200g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting the worktop
- 1 tsp fast-action dried yeast
- 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing
- 120ml lukewarm water

### Bake the pizzas:
- Spread the pizza dressing mixture evenly over the pizza bases, leaving a 2cm gap around the edge.
- Arrange the potato slices on top in an overlapping pattern.
- Drizzle the pizzas with 1 tbsp olive oil and bake for 9 minutes until the edges are crisp and golden.

### Make the fridge-raid dressing:
- With the food processor still running, slowly pour in the remaining 60ml of oil until emulsified.
- Season with salt.
- Toss the gem lettuce with the dressing and sprinkle with 2 tsp black sesame seeds (or white), lightly toasted.

## 30 Minutes Resting/Serving Time
- Allow the pizzas to cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
- Serve the pizza slices and gem lettuce salad immediately.

This plan allows you to prepare the majority of the dishes in advance, then quickly assemble and bake the pizza while the lettuce salad comes together. With 30 minutes of hands-on time and 60 minutes of oven/resting time, you can have this 2-course meal ready to serve in under 2 hours.
