Pizza with lettuce side and Cheesecake 

## 30 Minutes Prep Time
- Preheat oven to 230Â°C.
- Prepare the pizza dressing ingredients - combine the mascarpone, pecorino, anchovies, sage and lemon zest in a small bowl. Set aside.
- Prepare the potato topping - thinly slice the new potatoes on a mandoline.
- Prepare the gem lettuce - trim the bottom of 12 gem lettuces and cut lengthways into eighths. Place in a large bowl.
- Make the fridge-raid dressing - in a food processor, blend the avocado, ginger, garlic, lemon zest and juice, chili and tahini with 75ml of the oil until smooth.

## 30 Minutes Active Cooking Time
### Make the pizza dough:
- In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, 1 tbsp olive oil and lukewarm water. Stir to combine, then knead for 5 minutes until soft and elastic.
- Divide the dough in half and transfer both pieces to a lightly floured surface.
- Working one piece at a time, use your hands to gently stretch and roll the dough into a rectangle about 30 x 20cm. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking tray.
- Repeat with the second piece of dough.

### Bake the pizzas:
- Spread the mascarpone mixture evenly over the pizza bases, leaving a 2cm gap around the edge.
- Arrange the potato slices on top in an overlapping pattern.
- Drizzle the pizzas with 1 tbsp olive oil and bake for 9 minutes until the edges are crisp and golden.

### Make the fridge-raid dressing:
- With the food processor still running, slowly pour in the remaining 60ml of oil until emulsified.
- Season with salt.
- Toss the gem lettuce with the dressing and sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds.

## 30 Minutes Resting/Serving Time
- Allow the pizzas to cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
- Serve the pizza slices and gem lettuce salad immediately.

This plan allows you to prepare the majority of the dishes in advance, then quickly assemble and bake the pizza while the lettuce salad comes together. With 30 minutes of hands-on time and 60 minutes of oven/resting time, you can have this 2-course meal ready to serve in under 2 hours.
